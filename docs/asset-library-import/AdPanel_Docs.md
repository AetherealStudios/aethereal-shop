## 1.1 Image props

To upload your custom images, you need to add textures to your project.

Go to Asset **Library > My Assets**.

Click **Add New > Texture > Choose files on your device**.

We recommend uploading images that share the same aspect ratio.

## 1.2 Loop seconds prop

Editing this prop determines the image loop interval in seconds.

## 1.3 Panel dimensions
The panel dimensions are defined by **panelWidth** and **panelHeight**. We strongly recommend setting the dimensions to match your uploaded imagesâ€™ aspect ratio. (For example, if your images are 1920x1080, keep the aspect ratio at 16:9.)
